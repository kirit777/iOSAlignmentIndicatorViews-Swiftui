# iOSAlignmentIndicatorViews-Swiftui


This project is a **SwiftUI Alignment Indicator Demo**, inspired by [iOSAlignmentIndicatorViews](https://github.com/gbmiranda/iOSAlignmentIndicatorViews). It demonstrates how to show alignment indicators when positioning views in **SwiftUI**.

## Features
- Detects alignment conditions dynamically
- Shows visual indicator lines when views align
- Supports center, edge, and object-to-object alignment
- Implements haptic feedback when alignment occurs

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by Gabriel Braga's **[iOSAlignmentIndicatorViews](https://github.com/gbmiranda/iOSAlignmentIndicatorViews)**, which showcases alignment indicators in **UIKit**. This implementation brings a similar feature set to **SwiftUI**.

## Usage
Simply drag the objects in the demo, and alignment indicators will appear when they align with other views or the parent container.

## License
This project is open-source and free to use.
